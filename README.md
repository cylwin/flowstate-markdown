Flow state markdown editor
=============

I would like to test this software :
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flowstate/id1051600144?mt=12
Wich get a lot of press, but it cost 15$... and I just want to try the effect of the "flow" on my brain.

The original flow app pitch
==========
The world is a hive of distractions, multi-tasking, and cultural ADD. Many sit down to write, only to find hours vanish with nothing to show but a trail of browser tabs. Flowstate is a response to the amphetaminic digital age, born out of ancient writing disciplines. It frees the writer to turn on, tune in, and block out.
If you exit early, or stop typing for longer than five seconds, all progress is lost. The only way to secure your work is by continuing to move until the session is complete.

The app
===========

The app is based on https://github.com/lepture/editor

By default the session is set to 5 minuts. And the time beetween 2 types is 7 seconds. It's the duration that works the best for me.

Contribute ?
=========
Feel free you are welcome, for the moment, the app is really basic and made in about 30minuts.
